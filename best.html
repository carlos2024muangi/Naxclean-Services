                <h2>Reasons to Consider a Naxclean Service</h2>
                Cleaning your home can be overwhelming, especially if you procrastinate or lack the time and energy. As clutter and dust accumulate, it can become a daunting mess. A house cleaning service can alleviate this stress and restore order and comfort to your space.
                We often overlook the fact that hiring help for housework is a viable option. In today’s world, it’s quite common for working individuals to find affordable cleaning services. 
    
                Hiring help doesn’t have to be a last resort. There’s nothing wrong with not wanting to do housework, even if you have the time. You might prefer to spend your free time on hobbies, personal projects, or simply having fun, and that’s perfectly acceptable.
    
                Ultimately, despite what previous generations have taught us, housework shouldn’t be viewed as a noble act to take pride in — it’s just maintenance that needs to be done by someone, and that someone doesn’t necessarily have to be you if you can afford it.
                Moreover, hiring a house cleaning service benefits not only you but also your family. With more free time, you can enjoy moments with your loved ones, and you'll be providing them with a clean and safe living environment.
                While pathogens like bacteria, mold, and fungi are often invisible to the naked eye, they can lead to various health issues. Regular house cleaning can give you peace of mind by eliminating these harmful microorganisms.
    
                These compelling reasons provide you with the assurance needed to choose Naxclean Services confidently.

            <h3>How long is an average cleaning service?</h3>
                The duration of a typical cleaning service largely depends on the condition of your home.
                On average, you can expect the cleaning to take between 4 to 8 hours. To get a more accurate 
                estimate, simply multiply the number of bedrooms in your house by 2 hours. For example, if you 
                have 3 bedrooms, the cleaning will likely take around 6 hours. Investing this time ensures a 
                thorough and satisfying clean that revitalizes your space! 
                <h3>When will I be charged? Do you accept cash or M-Pesa payment?</h3>
                Rest assured, you will only be charged once we have successfully completed your cleaning service 
                to your satisfaction. And yes, we happily accept both cash and M-Pesa payments for your convenience!
